# Research
I am a Research Associate working with Dr. Jonathan Lindner in at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC). I have experience in translational cardiology and acoustics and the application of ultrasound as a means of diagnostic imaging as well as a therapeutic technique.I am in the process of applying to graduate school. 
My primary research interests lie in computational aspects of biomedical imaging, though I am also eager to study related aspects of biomedical analysis, computational biology and bioinformatics.
A complete list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Sl9VUVgAAAAJ).
