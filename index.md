 # Research
 I am a Research Associate working with Dr. Jonathan Lindner in at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC). I have experience in translational cardiology and acoustics and the application of ultrasound as a means of diagnostic imaging as well as a therapeutic technique.

I am in the process of applying to graduate school. My primary research interests lie in computational aspects of biomedical imaging, though I am also eager to study related aspects of biomedical analysis, computational biology and bioinformatics.

A complete list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Sl9VUVgAAAAJ).


# Volunteering
I volunteer with [International Partners](https://internationalpartners.org/) on several projects covering computer literacy, early childhood educaiton, early career readiness, and stigmatization of disability.
I especially enjoy spending time with my dog, ![Borg/Users/muller/Documents/GitHub/mattmuller0.github.io/assets/Borg.jpeg). I also enjoy playing soccer, ultimate, hiking, rock climbing, and volunteering.
