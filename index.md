### Research Experience
I am currently studying biomedical informatics as a graduate student at the Vilcek Institute within [NYU Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/). I am interested in computational aspects of biomedical imaging and next generation sequencing technologies.

I am a Research Associate working with [Dr. Jonathan Lindner](https://www.ohsu.edu/people/jonathan-r-lindner-md) at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU) and the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC). My research covers ultrasound and cardiovascular disease. I study ultrasound as a tool for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes with and without the use of microbubble contrast agents to treat ischemic disease such as peripheral artery disease and myocardial infarction. Addtionally, I study aortic valve disease through a murine model of moderate aortic stenosis.

A complete list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Sl9VUVgAAAAJ).

### Volunteer Work
I volunteer with [International Partners](https://internationalpartners.org/) on grant writing, planning, and implementation of several projects covering:
- Computer literacy
- Early childhood educaiton
- Early career readiness
- Stigmatization of disability
